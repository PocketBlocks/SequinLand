__A Nukkit fork that aims to add new and pretty features to Nukkit! (And sometimes pushes the changes to upstream :wink:)__

Introduction
-------------

SequinLand is a Nukkit fork that aims to add new and pretty features to Nukkit.

We try to improve the "Nukkit experience" by improving the "vanilla Nukkit" with new fixes, features and other stuff.

Most of the "fixes, features and other stuff" are from PocketMine-MP and it's forks/spoons, but we also try to improve SequinLand by adding new and unseen features. (and also provide fixes for Nukkit)

Of course, kudos to everyone and anyone that helped Nukkit to become what it is today, without them, Nukkit probably wouldn't even exist.

When a feature is considered "stable", the feature is pushed to upstream as a pull request.

Why fork Nukkit?
-------------

SequinLand was forked because of the fact that upstream does not accept many contributions that are intended to better the ecosystem. Simply put, SequinLand aims to better
the ecosystem by allowing changes to be exposed to a wider audience more quickly.

SequinLand will still track upstream Nukkit and merge changes as needed.
